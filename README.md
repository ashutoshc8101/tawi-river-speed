### Problem 1: Find the speed of Tawi River using Image processing and App Development

- Our solution is an application that provides functionality to record a flowing stream of water and view its flow speed live on an android device.

### Algorithm Used to calculate flow speed:
**Optical Flow**:
Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of the object or camera. It is a 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from the first frame to the second.
Optical flow works on several assumptions:
The pixel intensities of an object do not change between consecutive frames.
Neighboring pixels have similar motions.
